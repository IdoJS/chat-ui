I've choose to use Redux to manage the application states,
All chat message history stored in Redux-Store.

Components structure:
---------------------
App{
    Login
    ChatRoom {
        Title
        MessageList {
            MessageListItem
        }
        SendMessage
    }
}

Login - set chat user (avatar, name, id).
Title - show the userName and Avatar.
MessageListItem - show chat massages (text, timestamp, userName, avatar).

Store:
------
Redux update the store base on message received from socketObserver

Service:
--------
socketObserver - simple observer pattern to monitor the socket communication.
